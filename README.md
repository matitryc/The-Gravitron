# The Gravitron

My first TypeScript project. It is a browser game, compatible on all desktop devices, capable of multiplayer gameplay.
The game is short, but it's very fun. It allowed me to revise **ALL** the technologies I've learned so far.
It was a really pleasant way to revise and put to practice everything I know about TypeScript.
I've had a lot of fun coding and coming up with different ideas.
TODO: make the game playable for mobile devices by adding two buttons which react on touch events.
