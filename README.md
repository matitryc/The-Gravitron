# The Gravitron

My first OOP project. It is a browser game, compatible on most devices, capable of multiplayer gameplay.
The game is short, but it's very fun. It allowed me to revise **ALL** the technologies I've learned so far.
It uses Vue 3 with Composition API, TypeScript, Pinia, Eslint and Tailwind CSS.
